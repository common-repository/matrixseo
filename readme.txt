== Description ==
Probably **the most advanced SEO plugin** for WordPress.
Includes multisite network (MS) support.

== Screenshots ==
1. **Stats** - A bird view over MatrixSEO stats (search engine visits, visitors from search engines, actions received from API.
2. **Settings** - If you *really* want to change the search engines ips and referrer finger prints you can do that in the Settings tab of the MatrixSEO plugin. Also you may activate the debug and set the verbosity level, view and upgrade your API key.
3. **Actions** - Take a peak in MatrixSEO actions. The last 10 actions are displayed (but you can search for more). You may also choose to "ignore" a certain action or - if you wish - apply it again after ignoring.
4. **Advanced** - Change the start and end *title separators* in the Advanced tab. Also you may force the update of stop words from API or repopulate the action files if you accidentally deleted them.
5. **Debug Tail** - If you have activated the debug, you will see the debug tail in this tab, the file size of the debug file and also a button to clear the log.
